# Project Proposal: Sudoku Game and Solver in C++ 

Sudoku Game:
1. Create an interactive Sudoku game with a command line interface (CLI).
2. Allow users to play Sudoku by inputting numbers into stdin.
3. Implement features such as checking the validity of the entered numbers and providing feedback on incorrect inputs.

Sudoku Solver:
Develop a Sudoku solver algorithm that can automatically solve Sudoku puzzles (if you enter -2 -2 -2)

User Interface:
Design a user-friendly CLI for the Sudoku game, providing clear instructions and a visually appealing interface.

Game State Persistence:
1. Allow users to save and load Sudoku game states to continue playing at a later time (using -1 -1 -1)

# C++ Features:
Object-Oriented Design:
1. Use classes to represent the Sudoku game, cells, and any other necessary entities.
2. Encapsulate functionality within classes for modularity.

STL Usage:
1. Utilize the Standard Template Library (STL) for managing data structures such as vectors or arrays for the Sudoku grid.

Algorithmic Design:
1. Implement an efficient backtracking algorithm for the Sudoku solver.
2. Design clear algorithms for user input validation and Sudoku puzzle generation.
