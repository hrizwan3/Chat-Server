# Project Proposal: Sudoku Game and Solver in C++ 

Sudoku Game:
1. Create an interactive Sudoku game with a command line interface (CLI).
2. Allow users to play Sudoku by inputting numbers into a 9x9 grid.
3. Implement features such as checking the validity of the entered numbers and providing feedback on incorrect inputs.

Sudoku Solver:
1. Develop a Sudoku solver algorithm that can automatically solve Sudoku puzzles.
2. Allow users to input unsolved Sudoku puzzles, and the solver will display the solution.

User Interface:
1. Design a user-friendly CLI for the Sudoku game, providing clear instructions and a visually appealing interface.
Game Difficulty Levels:
2. Implement different difficulty levels for Sudoku puzzles (easy, medium, hard) to cater to users with varying skill levels.

Game State Persistence:
1. Allow users to save and load Sudoku game states to continue playing at a later time.

# C++ Features:
Object-Oriented Design:
1. Use classes to represent the Sudoku game, solver, and any other necessary entities.
2. Encapsulate functionality within classes for modularity.

STL Usage:
1. Utilize the Standard Template Library (STL) for managing data structures such as vectors or arrays for the Sudoku grid.

Algorithmic Design:
1. Implement an efficient backtracking algorithm for the Sudoku solver.
2. Design clear algorithms for user input validation and Sudoku puzzle generation.
